# Code for Sugimoto-Dimitrova et al. (in prep.)

## Quick Start Guide:
1. Download the public data set from Santos and Duarte (2016)
   and add it to the "Santos2016Data" folder.
2. Run run_main.m to generate figures from Sugimoto-Dimitrova et al.
   (in prep.)


## Organization of the repository:
\zIP\             contains functions for computing zIP from data 
                  and from models
\model\           contains functions related to the balance model and
                  simulation
\data_processing\ contains a custom cross-spectral density function that
                  detrends each data segment


## Acknowledgements:
The simulation code is largely based on Shiozawa et al. (2021)
